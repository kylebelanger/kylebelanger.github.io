<h4>About</h4>

<img class="about-img" src="/img/me.jpg" align="left">

I'm a student at the University of Baltimore, studying Information Technology with a focus in software development. I also work part-time as a supplimental instructor/tutor for the Java language courses. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, outdoor backpacking, and indoor gardening.

I have some Web accounts: <a href="http://twitter.com/ksbelanger">Twitter</a>; <a href="http://facebook.com/ky.blnr">Facebook</a>; and <a href="http://github.com/kylesb">GitHub</a>.
