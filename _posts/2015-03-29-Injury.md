Well, I guess it's true that "nothing can set you back like an injury". I literally "hopped" off the treadmill on Wednesday after running two miles. I set the off button, but didn't wait for the tread to completly stop. I landed on my left leg and now have extreme pain in the inner region of my left knee. 

I started putting ice on my knee today (Saturday). It's been three days since the injury and it still doesn't feel much better. 

I've already decided that I have to take a hiatus this week and hopefully everything will be healed by next weekend.
