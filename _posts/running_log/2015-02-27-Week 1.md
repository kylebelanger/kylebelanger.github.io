"I ran because I wanted to, but I ran because I had to: running saved my life." - Scott Belanger

I bought my first pair of running shoes in over 10 years last week. I didn't play sports in highschool, but I've always been somewhat athletic and thin. Over the past year, however, I noticed a few extra pounds have been difficult to shed. Aside from weight, I'm hoping that running will help cope with anxiety and other personal problems. 

Friday 2015-02-20

	I hit the treadmill in the upstairs gym at 11:00pm on a Friday. There's no one else in the gym, so it's just me and my inner deamons (...ha). 

	Pace: 4.5
	Distance: 1.5
	Sets: 2

Week 1 (02/20 - 02-28)

	Distance: 8 miles
