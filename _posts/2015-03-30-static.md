Over the past couple years, I've written many static (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) websites for work, school, and personal endevours.

Looking back at some of these websites, I'm kind of horrified at the way I wrote markup (almost as if it was a foreign language that needed 3 lines of comments to explain what was happening... ha). Now that I've learned best practices, it's easy to say "wow, why did I do it like that?"

Regardless, I figured that I would publish a small collection of web(pages/sites) that I'm (kind of) satisfied with. 

<style type="text/css">
	.web-block {
		float: left;
		clear: both;
		border-bottom: thin dotted grey;
	}

	.block-img {
		float: left;
		width: 350px;
		height: auto;
		opacity: .5;
		border: thin dotted grey;
	}
	.block-img:hover {
		opacity: 1;
	}
</style>

<div class="web-block">
	<img src="/img/posts/static/waves.png" class="block-img">
	<p>Project Waves (webpage)</p>
</div>

<div class="web-block">
	<img src="/img/posts/static/fantasia.png" class="block-img">
	<p>Fantasia Kennel (webpage)</p>
</div>

<div class="web-block">
	<img src="/img/posts/static/ub.png" class="block-img">
	<p>University of Baltimore - COSC-251 (website)</p>
</div>

<div class="web-block">
	<img src="/img/posts/static/muffin.png" class="block-img">
	<p>Mara's Muffins (website)</p>
</div>
