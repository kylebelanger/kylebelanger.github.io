A beautiful D3 learning experiment - a simple line graph displaying (past 30 days) temperature data for any location. 

## About

One of my goals this spring is to correctly learn and become more comfortable when working with JavaScript. I say "correctly learn" because like many web-developers out there, I've used random bits of JavaScript and jQuery for various things, yet I haven't taken the time to actually learn it pragmatically. My aspirations of becoming a web-developer are somewhat ((hindered)) with my inabilitity of knowing JS, but I've been gradually learning.

In my opinion, the best way to learn (just about anything) is by practice. You can read all of the books, manuals, and referance guides you'd like, but actually creating and visualizing things with <code/> is truly the best learning methology. 

I came across the D3 library from an instructor, and decided to experiment with it. This first project uses D3's charting functions to create a simple line graph with interactive tooltip. It displays (past 30 days) temperature data for any location. * The free API only gives 30 day intervals.
