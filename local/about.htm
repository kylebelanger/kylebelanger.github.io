<img class="post-img" src="/img/me.jpg" align="left">

I'm a student at the University of Baltimore, studying Information Technology with a focus in software development. I also work part-time as a supplimental instructor/tutor for the Java language courses. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, outdoor backpacking, and indoor gardening.

I have some Web accounts which are sometimes used: Twitter; and GitHub.
